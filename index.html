                <p class="desc">In 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, Satsuki and
                    Mei (approximately ten and four
                    years old, respectively), move into an old house to be closer to the hospital where the girls'
                    mother, Yasuko, is
                    recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits
                    called susuwatari
                    which can be seen when moving from bright to dark places. When the girls become comfortable
                    in their new house,
                    the susuwatari leave to find another empty house.

                <p class="desc">In Muromachi Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon. The last Emishi
                    prince, Ashitaka, kills it before
                    it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curse him before its death. The curse
                    grants him superhuman
                    strength, but it also causes him pain and will eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the
                    demon was a boar
                    god, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he
                    may find a cure in
                    the western lands that the demon came from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.

                <p class="desc">Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home when her
                    father decides to take a shortcut.
                    The family's car stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement
                    park which Chihiro's
                    father insists on exploring, despite his daughter's protest. They find a seemingly empty restaurant
                    still stocked with
                    food, which Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro reaches an
                    enormous bathhouse
                    and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset.
